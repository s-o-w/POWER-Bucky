These are available data models that a user might want to query information from:

    Power Delivery Quaility Managment System model (alias = PDQMS):
        The POWER Power Delivery Quality Management System (PDQMS) is a comprehensive framework designed to ensure the quality and effectiveness of Power Delivery projects. The PDQMS process consists of several high-level processes, including project initiation, design, QAQC (Quality Assurance/Quality Control), closeout, audit, reporting, and unlisted. The PDQMS process involves:
            1. Selecting a relevant high-level process from the list provided.
            2. Identifying QMS documents, processes, tools, workflows, and training that apply to the chosen process.
            3. Providing a description or name for an existing process that may need to be reviewed, refreshed, or removed.
            4. Summarizing the request by giving a brief summary of the process and any issues involved.
            5. Offering ideas for improvement or replacement of the mentioned processes.
            6. Including a Process Document URL that links to the current standard process documentation in a document management system.
        The PDQMS covers various aspects such as QAQC processes for different project types (e.g., distribution, transmission lines, substation), performance evaluation and customer satisfaction monitoring measures.  Use this model when a user requires information from POWER's PDQMS process and/or if they mention specific keywords related to quality management systems or ask about Power Delivery project processes and procedures related to quality assurance/control or customer satisfaction evaluations.

    POWER AUS proposal model (alias = POWERAUS):
        this model is meant to provide examples of previously written proposals, scopes, project information, and implementation details of work performed by POWER Engineer's AUS group for utility clients.  This work could be Utility Network (UN) Implementations, GIS and/or ESRI implementations and configurations, DERMS, DEERs and other distribution and ADMS system installation and configurations.  The AUS model will help users create new proposal and project documentation from these examples.

    POWER Substation KMP model (alias = PDSUBKMP):
        The POWER Engineers, Inc. (POWER) Knowledge Management Program (KMP), is a company-wide activity to promote and facilitate the sharing of technical information related to substation engineering and electrical engineering among all POWER staff. Knowledge management is “An integrated, systematic approach to identifying, acquiring, transforming, developing, disseminating, using, sharing, and preserving knowledge, relevant to achieving specified objectives." The KMP describes processes to perform substation design and electrical engineering for varoius clients, using design tools like AutoCad, Microstation, and many BIM tools like ACADE, Inventor, Bentley iTwin, Autodesk construction cloud, Autodesk Vault, and also explains how our clients share and define our CAD (computer Aided Drafting) and CAE (Computer aided engineering) standards and processes.  The goal is to provide POWER users with a consistent vision to facilitate the following main objectives with the intended goal of increasing project efficiencies and quality:
        · Capture and share valuable project experiences and developments. This is also referred to as providing “feedback of value”, and is critical to the success of the KMP.
        · Transfer and share knowledge
        · Facilitate development of knowledgeable staff
        · Identify an efficient means to make our most knowledgeable staff available to clients when needed
        · Provide known tools to quickly locate reference information
        · Provide for cross-training and coordination opportunities between different Business Units and Divisions for common knowledge subjects
        Based on these objectives, the KMP includes three distinct components and describes the necessary interactions between each component. These components include:
        · Existing Knowledge about substation design and substation electrical engineering
        · Knowledge Transfer about substation design and substation electrical engineering
        · Project Support about substation design and substation electrical engineering
        A common database will serve as a repository for sharing information developed by each of the components noted above. The database consists of three components, the Library, the Wiki and the Forum. The Library is currently configured independently by Business Unit or Division and utilizes both ProjectWise and SharePoint. The goal is to ultimately condense our libraries into a single platform. The Wiki is a collection of open source websites maintained by each Division or Business Unit. The forum is a tool included in the new Portal tool (Interact) and will facilitate collaboration across KMP participants.
